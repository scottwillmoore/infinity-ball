# Infinity Ball

## Purpose

I have put this game up on GitHub as a way to preserve an old project. This was the first game that I have ever created and was built way back when I was in high school for a school project. None of the code in this repository is *good* code, but it does (at least in my eyes) reflect how much I have improved over the following years.

A fun class to have a look at is `Renderer.java`. Notice how I obviously didn't quite yet understand the motivation behind a Sprite**Batch** (and ShapeRenderer). In case it is not clear, a SpriteBatch is designed to 'batch' together renderering operations in order to drastically improve performance. Nevertheless, the code did its job - and it never appeared to have any performance implication on the game.

## Building

Good luck. I do not remember...
